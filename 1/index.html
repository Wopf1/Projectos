                <h2>What We Do</h2> 
                <p>Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are scattered all over this planet; you just need to 
                        know where to find them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca Trail are out there, 
                        waiting for you to walk all over them. We’re proud of our record of successful ascents (over 92% of our travellers 
                        make it to the top of Kili, depending on the route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides that make the journey itself 
                        as memorable as the summit. And if you’re not into big climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks 
                        and iconic treks you’ll love, too.</p>

                    <p>She has booked two major European trips for us in the past year and every 
                        aspect has met, and in most cases exceeded, our expectations. Best prices, 
                        best hotels, best itineraries, and best cruises, she does it all. But the 
                        most important thing is she remembers the little things that we would do 
                        if we were making the plans ourselves.</p>

                    <p>Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for about 20 years and 
                        there is no one else I would trust to arrange my trips and tours. I've 
                        also had great  fun on a few of the group trips she has arranged - Peru 
                        & Machu Picchu and a 10-day cruise out of Venice and diving. It's always 
                        an eclectic group of well traveled, interesting people.</p>
